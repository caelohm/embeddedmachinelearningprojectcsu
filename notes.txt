CHART NOTES
EDM chart: For some reason, Vince Staples - Big Fish Theory likes to be on front page, only has UK Garage as influence not genre. Exclude Hardcore Hip Hop to remove.

All charts are sorting by top rated, but are weighed heavily to include popular albums even if they aren't top rated

All charts include soundtracks that have the proper genre tag

Have now decided to decrease number of songs per genre to 50 instead of 100 (certain less popular genres do not have enough data to justify 100 songs)
